# Purpose

A simple repo containing various things to help me setup a new machine.

# Installation

1. Clone the repo to `~/.machine-setup`

2. `git submodule update --init`


## Scripts

### apps.sh

Opens a bunch of urls to applications that need to be downloaded and installed. I avoided automating this since I could not come up with a good way to get urls to the latest versions of the apps.

### macOS-Defaults.sh

Sets various preferences for macOS using the `defaults` command.

### git-setup.sh

Aliases various configuration files relevant to configuring git.

### third-party-tools.sh

Installs various third party tools such as HomeBrew and rbenv.
